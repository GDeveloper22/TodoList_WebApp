# Todo_List_WebApp
A basic todo list webapp


This is the Version 2.0 of the ToDo list web app

In the previous version the user was able to:
  Users can add task
  mask as complete with time Stamps
  delete them

I have added the new features:
  In the Previous version the data was not stored locally, But now it can be stored locally. Hence, you no need to worry about your data.
  After you delete your task it is also delerted from the local storage.
